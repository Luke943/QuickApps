A basic calculator GUI built from PyQt5, coded without designer.exe.
The calculator is quite buggy, this was mainly created to test PyQt5.

Files:
- calculator.py has the main calculator class
- app-???.py files call from calculator and add styling. Two versions have different approaches to styling, but function the same.
- various .qss files can be imported for styling
